Just marking the 2nd/3rd week of using Yousician to learn guitar, singing, and basic music theory. The gamification aspect of it is very addicting and useful, and it has important lessons in game design and potential audiences.

It appears that people love a game that actually has real world positive impact, whether it's really learning an instrument a la Rocksmith vs something artifical like Guitar Hero.

This Wired article (https://www.wired.com/2015/05/this-video-game-solved-the-problem-of-learning-guitar/) has motivated to continue to learn the guitar but also to apply aspects of gamification to this game and tie it to real world impact.

It also recommends a great running app called Zombies Run that I definitely will try since it has the "adventure" and "story" aspect that actually motivates people to run! Great gamification idea.

Some other gamified apps with rankings/score/sense of improvement that have positively influenced my education and life:
leetcode.com
Duolingo
