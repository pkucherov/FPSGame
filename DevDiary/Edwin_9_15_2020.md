1. Build Unreal Engine from source
2. Run dedicated server and clients
3. Packaged both into executables
4. Have clients access servers through IP addresses and port forwarding (level blueprint)
5. Played around with Amazon Gamelift (basically EC2 made simpler)
6. Learned how to release unreal project into executable for distribution to users (using Unrealfrontend with release configurations)

IP forwarding using Router interface
As a basic nonprod testing for the server build, have blueprint in Unreal level with the IP address
