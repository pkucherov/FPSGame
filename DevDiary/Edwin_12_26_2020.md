Philosophical musings based on watching Alan Watts that also inspired the South Park creators to produce animations for.

Life should not be treated as a journey and should be treated as music, and we should play the music and dance. The finale doesn't matter.

As analogy to an open world game, the ending is disappointing and a letdown for me typically because it should have been the journey and gameplay that is the focus for me. I feel let down because it feels i wasted all of my time beforehand accumulating gear and levels.

We are conditioned that life should go somewhere. Life is a dance, dancing is not about going somewhere, but to dance.

What do I want? I don't know. Why don't you know? 1. You have it. 2. You don't know yourself because you never can.

David Foster wallace: everyone worships. It depends on what you worship.

Alan Watts: Be present so you are free from all suffering. Get rid of ego and become your true self.

Joe Rogan: It's all about momentum. Exercise a little bit and then get going

Elon Musk: Build an exciting future to inspire us

Good comment:
"I feel that as a gamer , someone that plays open world games a lot like minecraft this idea can be seen there as well. I find that i always go back to the basic if i achieved all the things the game has to offer, i just go back to the basics i guess you can say the process of getting there feels way more rewarding than actually being there. Thats all"

As for the video game, I learned more about how having Blueprint Game Modes and Classes can OVERWRITE the default project settings (in the editor and also specified in DefaultEngine.ini) as well as have different HUDS, Pawns, and Hero classes for different maps
