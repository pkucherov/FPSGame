Now I need to do 4 things:
1. Make the knife attach better to the Player and swing animation
2. Physics Gun to generate barricades and repair and "impulse push" them. There are a lot of examples of doing a gravity gun in blueprints, but I want to do it in C++ since barricades are an important part of the game. My initial thoughts are simple: follow the spawn projectile weapon code closely, but spawn a barricade instead of a projectile. The barricade should be MOVABLE to get rid of a pesky warning.
3. Implement Gamplay Ability System (GAS) to scale the project without worrying about lag/client-prediction/server rollback overmuch. This should also help with necessary attributes such as shield and mana/energy. There are good tutorials despite the dearth of offical documentation and tutorials.
4. Port FPSGame to Unreal 4.26 to take advantage of bug improvements for GAS plugin. Apparently it's not beta anymore with 4.26 and the water system is cool?
