Implementing melee as another weapon for now since gameplay ability system is slightly overkill for now

Also implementing standard rule set

Looking into making objects interactable by using a trigger box and collisions, similar to the GAS tutorial without the bells and whistles. User presses E within trigger box, do an action (open a door/repair a barricade/move a barricade)
