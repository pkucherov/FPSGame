Epic's Gameplay ability system is interesting but it may be overkill for shooters. There are ideas I want to borrow to fold my own system but right now the only real "ability" is a barricade/physics gun for techies.

We do want to implement abilities for players eventually and it may be worth to bite the bullet if this is easily extendable later on instead of relying on the Weapons.

>I try to use GAS for as much as possible. Knowing the replication aspects are "handled" is very comforting. Also even without using Abilities or Effects, Gameplay Tags are hugely beneficial in their own right. Once you get your parent classes created, things start to go very smoothly. Simply copying or making children of parent classes and tweak as needed.

>The c++ was a bear to get through, especially since I came into it with zero C++ experience, (and any I've learned has been via GAS).

>Once everything is setup and working, the system has made developing a multiplayer game a lot easier. Once the c++ is taken care off, most of the development IS in blueprints. Gameplay Abilities & Gameplay Cues can all be done in BP. The main C++ stuff is Attribute Sets, Damage Executions (if you use them), and setting up the component.
